				<h3>Context</h3>
				<p>Papel bijoux was born at the hand of Eliana Esquivel, an artisan who expresses and creates art
					through various forms. When she found herself out of work after a difficult time in her life,
					turning to her creations as a means of generating income was a natural choice. Each piece of jewelry
					is made entirely by hand through a painstaking process and Mrs. Esquivel mainly sells her products
					at artisan fairs and markets in different locations in the city.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<!--DESAFIO-->
		<div class="row mt-5">
			<div class="col-sm desafio">
				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Our client, Eliana, manifested an interest in digitizing the sale of her jewelry. She expressed the
					importance of growing her business and also diminishing the time she spends planning and attending
					artisan markets in order to have more time to invest in creating and selling her pieces from the
					comfort of her home.</p>

	<!--ENTENDIMIENTO DEL PROBLEMA-->
	<div class="container">
		<div class="row mt-5">
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h3>Defining the Problem</h3>
				<p>Mrs. Esquivel’s direct contact with her clients is mainly at the stand of the various artisan markets
					she attends. Her granddaughter, Catalina Cespedes, recently created an Instagram account for the
					jewelry business but due to how new the account is, it hasn’t gained much popularity as of yet.
				</p>
				<p>During the interview conducted with both parties, we were made aware of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Instagram account created less than a month ago</li>
					<li>Account has very few followers</li>
					<li>The account has not been reached by many</li>
					<li>The only users who know of the account are acquaintances and family members</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

		<!--BENCHMARK-->
		<div class="row mt-5">
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h3>Benchmark</h3>
				<p>Due to the fact that our client already owned an Instagram account, we decided to start our research
					by investigating similar businesses within the same social media network. We realized early on that
					since the Papel Bijoux account had been created so recently, it lacked many of the elements that
					could potentially facilitate the growth and audience reach of the business. In addition, we
					investigated miscellaneous e-commerce websites that deal in similar products in order to draw
					inspiration and get a jump-start on the ideation of a useful digital marketplace.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<!--HIPOTESIS-->
		<div class="row mt-5">
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It is not easy for the user to attain detailed information about the business or its items for
						sale due to how recently the Instagram account was created.</li>
					<li>The Instagram account doesn’t reach many followers; therefore, the only people who are aware of
						said account are acquaintances of Mrs. Esquivel or users who come in contact with the jewelry
						stand</li>
					<li>The painstaking process of creating each piece of jewelry doesn’t translate through the account.
						It lacks photos that show the technique and the materials used.</li>
					<li>We believe that if specific visual changes are made to the account and more information is
						presented, the account could reach a larger audience and increase sales. </li>
					<li>If the quality of the materials used and the process of creation is presented, it will
						demonstrate the real value each piece of jewelry possesses. </li>

				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>
						As we began sketching our initial design, we decided to prioritize exhibiting our client’s personal story, the quality of the materials utilized, and the reflection of the origami tradition in Mrs. Esquivel’s products. 

					</p>
					<p>Mainly, our objective was to create a web page that was straightforward, easy to use, and that would effectively express what we wanted to portray: The artist’s story and process.</p>
					<p>
						In order to achieve such venture, we created a section with a short biography of the artist that would be displayed on the right side of the page during every step of the navigation process. A longer version of this section would be available on the homepage of the website as a way for our audience to empathize with our client, engage on an emotional level, and encourage sales. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to what was mentioned before, we also considered the desire our client expressed to migrate her sales to the digital world. Therefore, we created a navigation bar located at the top of the website which contained the various jewelry categories available for purchase (earrings, necklaces, collections, etc). Once a category was selected, an array of products would be displayed, each containing basic information such as the name of the piece, an image, and its price. A further selection of a specific item would disclose more images for further inspection, a small description of the item, the materials used, the price, and a purchase button. In case of a purchase, a shopping cart area was also made available to conclude the payment of the product.

			<p>
				In light of the feedback we received during the usability testing of our wireframe, we decided to implement some of those details in the high-fidelity design we created. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The visual design decisions were based on the existing logo we were provided by the client at the beginning of the project and on our desire to mirror the Japanese patterns from the materials used to make the jewelry. It was also important to maintain a minimalistic design in order efficiently highlight the product. 
			</p>
			<p>This final design was also tested and iterated until we achieved a product that would not only meet our client’s needs, but also that of her target users. </p>

		<!--CONCLUSIONES-->
		<div class="row mt-5">
			<h3>Conclusions</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="row mb-5">
			<p>
				We came into this project without a clear vision of what we wished to develop. Papel Bijoux, being such a small business and having just begun flirting with the idea of exploring the digital space, left an enormous world of possibility. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our first week was dedicated to research and understanding the artisan world in which our client made a living. During this time we noticed that this whimsical jewelry business lacked a few important details to thrive in the ecommerce arena but we also saw its tremendous potential, which ultimately became our driving force until the end.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to developing our final product, we had considered implementing changes solely to our client’s Instagram page, but the information we gathered during our investigation  pointed us in another direction.
			</p>
			<p>We concluded that by creating an online marketplace for our client, she’d be able to smoothly transition her sales into the digital world and just as importantly, improve her quality of life. </p>
			<p>It made us quite content to have the possibility of exposing the world to the handcrafted jewelry pieces made by a resilient and hardworking woman who so lovingly dedicates her life to bring art and uniqueness to our hectic lives.</p>
